            Management: Managed by a team of young people from Nepal who are passionate about swimming, the environment, and community development.
            We envision Forest Run as a place where people can come together to relax, have fun, and learn about each other's cultures. We want it to be a space where people of all ages can feel safe and welcome, and where they can enjoy the beauty of nature.
            
            We believe that Forest Run can play a valu  able role in the community by providing a healthy and affordable alternative to traditional swimming pools. We also believe that it can be a catalyst for social change by bringing people together from different backgrounds and cultures.
            
            We are committed to making Forest Run a reality, and we are excited to see what the future holds for this project.
            
            Here are some specific steps that we plan to take to make Forest Run a reality:
            
            Identify a suitable location: We have already begun scouting potential locations for Forest Run. We are looking for a forest that is easily accessible, has a beautiful swimming spot, and has enough space for people to gather and socialize.
            Raise funds: We will need to raise funds to cover the costs of construction, maintenance, and programming. We are planning to apply for grants, hold fundraising events, and solicit donations from individuals and businesses.
            Build the pool: Once we have raised the necessary funds, we will begin construction of the pool. We plan to use natural materials and sustainable practices to create a pool that is both beautiful and environmentally friendly.
            Develop programming: We will offer a variety of programming at Forest Run, including swimming lessons, water aerobics, yoga classes, and cultural events. We also plan to host community events such as potlucks, concerts, and festivals.
            Manage the facility: Forest Run will be managed by a team of young people from Nepal who are passionate about swimming, the environment, and community development. The team will be responsible for maintaining the facility, organizing programming, and providing customer service.
            We believe that Forest Run has the potential to be a valuable asset to the community. We are excited to see what the future holds for this project.</h3>
